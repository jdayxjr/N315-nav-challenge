This is a group effort. Your team must make a totally responsive site that has navigation that changes to a mobile navigation. It must have at least 4 links and change content. You must use the MVC model. Also, you don't have to have a ton of content on each page. Just load some on there.  Choose a leader and have that leader put both your names in the README.md file and then upload the Gihub link. Hint: use Github or something like that to help with working as a team.
